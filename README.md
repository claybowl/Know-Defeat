# Algorithmic Trading System

## Overview
A comprehensive algorithmic trading system with sub-minute trading capabilities, probability-based decision making, and dynamic weight adjustments. The system includes tick-level data processing, backtesting capabilities, and real-time market analysis.

## Key Features
- Probability engine for trade execution decisions
- Dynamic weight adjustment system for algorithm ranking
- Tick-level data processing and storage
- Real-time market data integration
- Automated backtesting framework
- Performance metrics and analytics

## Technical Architecture
- **Database**: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension) for time-series data
- **API Integration**: Support for Interactive Brokers, Polygon.io
- **Processing**: GPU-accelerated calculations for weight optimization
- **Storage**: Optimized for high-frequency tick data (~350GB for 30 days)

## Core Components
1. **Probability Engine**
   - Analyzes historical performance
   - Generates success probability metrics
   - Dynamic algorithm ranking

2. **Bot Management**
   - Algorithm combinations
   - Independent operation
   - Ranking-based fund allocation

3. **Data Processing**
   - Tick-level data handling
   - Market data compression
   - Real-time analytics

## Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables for tick data and trades
CREATE TABLE tick_data (
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    volume INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, symbol)
);

-- Additional tables for simulated and real trades
CREATE TABLE simulated_trades (...);
CREATE TABLE real_trades (...);
```

## Installation
1. Install PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB
2. Set up the database:
```bash
psql -U username postgres
CREATE DATABASE stockdata;
\c stockdata
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
```

## Configuration
- Database path: "C:/Users/[username]/postgres_data"
- Required storage: Minimum 350GB for 30 days of tick data
- Recommended hardware: 32GB RAM, 8+ core CPU
- GPU support: NVIDIA cards recommended for weight calculations

## Usage
1. Initialize the database
2. Configure data sources
3. Start the probability engine
4. Monitor bot performance through the ranking system

## Performance Metrics
- Win rates across multiple timeframes
- Profit per second
- Algorithm rankings
- Risk-adjusted returns

## Future Development
- Machine learning integration for weight optimization
- Enhanced circuit breakers
- Bloomberg Terminal integration
- Extended backtesting capabilities
